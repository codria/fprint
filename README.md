# fprint


`fprint` is a highly customizable replacement for Python's built-in `print()` function.
It supports:

- Text and background color (named colors and HEX codes)
- Fixed-width table-style formatting
- Horizontal centering
- Proper support for full-width characters (e.g., Japanese)
- Bold text
- Line number display
- Indentation support

Ideal for scripts, CLI tools, and logs that need readable, structured, or visually enhanced output.
